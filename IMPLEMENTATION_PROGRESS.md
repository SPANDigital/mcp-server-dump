- [x] Handle both single-line and multi-line context values

## Phase 6: HTML and JSON Formatters ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] HTML formatter works via markdown conversion (no changes needed)
- [x] JSON formatter includes Context fields automatically via struct tags

## Phase 7: Context Matching Logic ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement exact name matching for tools and prompts
- [x] Implement URI pattern matching for resources (supports wildcards)
- [x] Handle multiple context files merging with proper precedence

## Phase 8: Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create example context.yaml with comprehensive examples
- [x] Test with simulated MCP server data
- [x] Verify all output formats (Markdown, JSON, PDF)
- [x] Test PDF generation with rich context content
- [x] Verify InputSchema appears before Context as required

## Files Modified ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] internal/model/server.go - Added Context fields to Tool, Resource, Prompt
- [x] internal/model/context.go (new) - Complete context configuration system
- [x] internal/app/cli.go - Added ContextFile CLI option
- [x] internal/app/runner.go - Added context loading and application logic
- [x] internal/app/templates/*.tmpl - Updated all templates for context rendering
- [x] internal/formatter/pdf.go - Enhanced PDF formatter with context support
- [x] internal/formatter/markdown.go - Added contains template function
- [x] internal/formatter/html.go - No changes needed (works via markdown)
- [x] internal/formatter/json.go - No changes needed (automatic via struct tags)

## Test Files ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] examples/context.yaml (comprehensive example configuration)
- [x] Tested with simulated MCP server data
- [x] All linting issues resolved

## Implementation Features ✅ DELIVERED

### Core Features:
- **Multiple Context Files**: `--context-file` can be used multiple times
- **YAML and JSON Support**: Context files can be in either format
- **Rich Content Support**: Multi-line values with markdown formatting
- **Pattern Matching**: Resources support URI pattern matching with wildcards
- **Template Integration**: Context rendered in all output formats

### Context Structure:
```yaml
contexts:
  tools:
    tool_name:
      key1: "Simple string value"
      key2: |
        Multi-line content with:
        - Lists
        - Code blocks
        - Formatting
  resources:
    "pattern/*":
      key1: "value1"
  prompts:
    prompt_name:
      key1: "value1"
```

### Output Behavior:
- **InputSchema appears before Context** (as requested)
- **Single-line values**: Rendered as bullet points
- **Multi-line values**: Rendered as formatted blocks
- **All formats supported**: Markdown, HTML, JSON, PDF

### Backward Compatibility:
- No breaking changes
- Context is completely optional
- Existing functionality preserved
- All tests pass

## Notes ✅ CONFIRMED
- ✅ Keep existing functionality intact
- ✅ Context is optional - no breaking changes
- ✅ InputSchema appears before context in output
- ✅ Support YAML and JSON context files
- ✅ All linting issues resolved
- ✅ Ready for production use
